# Comparing classification algorithms when applied on under sampled and over sampled data
This is the repository for the python code to evaluate the performance of classification algorithms when applied on upon over-sampled and under-sampled data


Usage Instructions
------------------

At the command prompt or Git Bash in windows, go the directory in which you want to keep this repository and type

    git clone git://github.com/nidsarora/Comparing-classification-algorithms-when-appliedon-under-sampled-and-over-sampled-data
This will create a directory called Comparing-classification-algorithms-when-appliedon-under-sampled-and-over-sampled-data in that folder. If you want to name it something else, you can by appending the folder name to that command.

    git clone git://github.com/nidsarora/Comparing-classification-algorithms-when-appliedon-under-sampled-and-over-sampled-data other-name

To keep up to date with the changes in this repository, you're going to want to *fetch* the changes that I make and put up on github. You do this from the folder you just created. This is your new repository.

    git fetch origin
